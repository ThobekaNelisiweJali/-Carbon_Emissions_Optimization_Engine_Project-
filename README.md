# 🌿 Carbon Emissions Optimization Engine (CEOE)

 **Sustainability & Green Logistics | AI-Driven Platform**
 [https://carbon-wise-logistics.lovable.app]

---

## Project Overview

**CEOE** (Carbon Emissions Optimization Engine) is an AI-powered platform designed to minimize carbon emissions across logistics and supply chain networks. By combining route optimization, freight type selection, and supplier scoring, CEOE enables businesses to transition toward more sustainable, environmentally conscious operations.

As global emissions from transportation continue to rise, this platform offers a **scalable, intelligent, and cost-effective solution** that empowers logistics companies and carbon-conscious brands to **measure, optimize, and reduce** their carbon footprint per shipment.

---

## Why It Matters

Transport and logistics contribute significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions. Companies are under increasing pressure to reduce their environmental impact—not only for compliance but also for brand reputation and cost efficiency.

With **CEOE**, we aim to:
-  Align logistics with global sustainability goals.
- Lower emissions while optimizing operational efficiency.
- Enable data-driven environmental decision-making.

## 🛠️ Key Features

| Feature                              | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  **Dynamic Route Optimization**    | Uses reinforcement learning to determine the most efficient and low-emission delivery paths. |
|  **Freight Type Selection**        | Matches shipments with the most sustainable transportation modes (e.g., rail, hybrid trucks). |
|  **Supplier Scoring System**       | Ranks suppliers based on emissions performance using historical data and LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) datasets. |
| **Emission Reporting & Auditing** | Generates carbon emissions reports for shipments, lanes, and partners. Enables third-party emission audits. |
|  **Reinforcement Learning Engine** | Continuously learns from shipment data to optimize decisions over time.     |
|  **LCA Dataset Integration**       | Integrates life cycle assessment (LCA) databases for accurate emissions modeling. |

###  Revenue Streams:
- **Monthly Licensing** to logistics providers and enterprises
- **Premium Emissions Audit Service** for ESG reporting
- **API Access** for integration into enterprise TMS/ERP systems
- **Data-Driven Insights** subscription for suppliers and partners

## 📊 Example Use Case

**Scenario**: A logistics company operates 100 weekly deliveries across South Africa. Using CEOE, they:
- Switch 40% of routes from road-only to rail-road hybrid.
- Reduce average emissions per shipment by 21%.
- Use supplier scores to switch to 3 lower-emission freight partners.

📈 Result: Lower emissions, cost savings, and improved ESG score.
